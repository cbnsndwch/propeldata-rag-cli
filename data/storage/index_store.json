You can use the pairs of parameters `first` and `after` or `last` and `before` to page forward or backward through the results, respectively.\n\n    For forward pagination, the `first` parameter defines the number of results to return, and the `after` parameter defines the cursor to continue from. You should pass the cursor for the _last_ result of the current page to `after`.\n\n    For backward pagination, the `last` parameter defines the number of results to return, and the `before` parameter defines the cursor to continue from.
